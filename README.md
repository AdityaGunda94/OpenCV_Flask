OpenCV Face and Eye detection in Flask web framework using pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers.
Here I am using Haar Cascade classifier on Real time webcam data to localize the objects in the video frames.
This is a Machine learning classifier available in Open-source computer vision library.
We can train the Haar Cascade by providing positive and negative samples to the algorithm.
